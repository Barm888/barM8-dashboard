                                Information</h1>
                            <p>If you wish to access the personal information that we hold about you, if your personal
                                information changes, or if you no longer wish to receive non-account specific
                                information from us, you can access, correct, update and/or ask us to remove personal
                                information about you that we have collected by emailing your request to us at
                                info@barm8.com.au or by using the functionality contained in the App (if any). When
                                updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we act
                                on your request. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
                                disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally
                                changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely
                                impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
                                Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except
                                where it would require a disproportionate effort. We seek to protect information from
                                accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from
                                the App, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may
                                not remove information from our backup systems.</p>

                            <p>You can choose whether or not to disclose certain personal information when we ask you to
                                do so, but some functions of the App may be more difficult or impossible to use if you
                                choose not to disclose certain personal information, and your experience in using the
                                App will not be as personally tailored.</p>
                            <p>To opt out of further direct marking from us, please contact us at [email]. To opt out of
                                further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information
                                has already been shared, please contact that partner directly. Please note that your
                                personal information may still be disclosed to third parties to the extent that you
                                provide it to third parties using the App (e.g. by posting it using functionality in the
                                App).</p>

                                We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including
                                physical security measures, to guard against unauthorised access to systems. Information
                                about Users that is maintained on our systems (or the systems of those who provide
                                service to us or on our behalf) is protected using industry standard security measures.
                                However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee that
                                your personal information will be completely secure. We are not responsible for the
                                circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures of the App by any Users or
                                third parties. As such, we recommend that you use caution whenever submitting personal
                                information online whether to us or to anyone else.</p>
